# Matrix_Dual_Clock
2 Max7219 matrix displays showing local and 

I’ve been putting this sketch together for a couple of weeks.  I’ve got most of it working but I can’t figure out a couple details.  I’ve watched every tutorial I can find and read everything I can find on the libraries but I can’t find the answers I need.  I’ve tried various suggestions but none of them work.

The only things I can’t figure out are setting either time to UTC (line 213 or 268), the display stops momentarily every second or two (I think that’s because of the DHT sensor (180) but I can’t find a way to fix it) and, lastly, I can’t figure out how to show the date without the year.  I know what year it is.  LOL
